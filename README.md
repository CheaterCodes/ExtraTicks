# ExtraTicks

    Not as gross as it sounds
    
A mod to improve vanilla performance issues without changing game mechanics.

## Introduction

This mod is intended to improve vanilla server performance by modifying parts of the game logic.
However, all modifications are developed in a way that the game logic works exactly the same as vanilla.
If you can find any difference between this and vanilla (apart from performance improvements) open an issue and I will fix it.

## Modules

For easier development the logic is split into multiple modulee, each patching a different part of the game.
The following list gives an overview about implemented fixes.
